# Recipe-Website

updated from Colt Steele code along (yelpcamp) project. Nodejs, MongoDB, Express and more used

Originally made in late 2019.

### You have to update the "config/keys.js" to connect it to your mongodb cluster.

Update 24/01/2024:

Fixed Deprecated stuff from express.js and font awesome. Created a new mongodb cluster. Updated the recipes. changed the theme to bakery.

Note to self:
-Heroku not working, fix it so you can share link.
-Maybe fix the buttons under the individual post. So the user can move between posts.
-While you are logged in, you can still access to login page and can log in as a different person. not quite sure if this is a security issue. investigate
